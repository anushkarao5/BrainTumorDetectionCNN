## Project Objective
The objectives of this project are to:
- Develop a convolutional neural network specialized in detecting glioma, pituitary, and meningioma brain tumors
- Utilize pre-trained models to increase recall in tumor classes
## Project Outcomes 
- Developed a simple CNN with a minimum 93% recall in all tumor classes and an average recall of 94% in tumor classes
- Applied transfer learning to EfficientNetB0 to achieve over 95% recall for all tumor classes and 96.4% average recall in the tumor classes
